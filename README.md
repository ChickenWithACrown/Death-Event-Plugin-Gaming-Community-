# Death-Event-Plugin-Gaming-Community-
The plugin is a custom plugin that I created for my Minecraft server called Gaming Community. The name of the plugin is "Death Event". When /deatheventstart is ran it will give all players a random timer from 1 min to 24 hours, to complete the task, ranging from growing a tree to respawning and killing the ender dragon.
